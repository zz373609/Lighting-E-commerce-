# Lighting E-commerce (一个轻量化电商运营方案)

After scrapy the 100000 chinese sellers information from amazon. I figure out that 99% of their product is from taobao, or 1688. but how much they sell is at list 2 * original price, some of them is like originla price * 10.

So, what I want to do is that make a auto spider to scrab the data from amazon and send it to my own store.

If you actully did research on amazon, or sell stuff on amazon, you will find that each product send to amazon to sell. You need fill a large form. This is not the hard part. The hard part is that evey product you can only have 30 request in 1 hour. If you can not finish the prudct information fill in 30 request, you need wait for a while. It will take you a long of time to send product to amazon. 

And, do you know what you are going to sell, and do you actully have those products. Even though you have those product, can you actully sell it out. You need buy products first and send out? it will cost a lot of money for sure.

Here is I come idea. I am doing a plateform called Krapher, What I am tring to do is that find product on amazon but also exit in taobao, and auto scrab the product from amazon and send to my store, once someone buy, then I will buy from taobao, and send to amazon. All this stuff can be done by computer. So in the future, What I can do is that , figure out the different price of different palteform, find the lower price one and send to higher price one to sell. What is my Krapher doing.

I am working on this project already, and I have amazon store also. The project doese not have frontend yet, but have some backend functional ready to use. I am using for now. If anyone interested in my idea, you can contact me, I can show you my system and teach you how to doing amazon seller in my way.

The price in Amzon is 36.37 ERU

![The price in taobao](https://github.com/zz373609/Lighting-E-commerce-/blob/master/WechatIMG38.png)

The price in taobao is 37.27 CNY

So you see the potential here 37.23 CNY * 10 is almost about 36.37 ERU. You got what I mean ?
